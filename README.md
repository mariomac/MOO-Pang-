Simple videogame created for my students of Object-Oriented Design and Programming.
Code and comments are in Spanish language.

Compiling and executing
-----------------------
From the console, go to the project root directory and type:

ant run

How to play
-----------
Use cursor keys <- y -> to move left and right.

Use spacebar to shot arrows. If an arrow hits a ball, the ball will be divided into
two smaller balls. When balls are small enough they will disappear when are hit by
an arrow.

If a ball hits you, game is over.
